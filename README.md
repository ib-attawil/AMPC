# AMPC Lane Following Project


## Requirements

- MATLAB version 2019b or higher (recommended)
- Model Predictive Control Toolbox
- Automated Vehicle Toolbox

## How to run

- To run the script that starts the simulation, open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder,also, add the simulink files folder to the matlab path(you can use the right click to do it). Then, type `helperAMPCSetUp` in the command window and press Enter.
- If the script does not work, you can open the Simulink file directly from the Simulink files folder. The file name is `AMPC_Lane_Following_Project.slx`.
- To turn on the 3D simulation, go to the 3D Simulation block in the Simulink model and check the box `display`.
